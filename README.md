# PDF-To-Excel
This script utilizes OpenCV for image recognition and PyTesseract for object character recognition to convert tables in a PDF to Excel.

In order to use this script, you need to install 4 libraries. Pdf2image, Opencv, openpyxl, and pytesseract.

Once you run the script and everything is functional, it will ask you to provide a path to an excel file. Simply write the path and press the convert button. It will then convert each page in the PDF to a JPEG. Once converted, drag and drop a box over the table it is you want to copy and press ENTER to confirm. Press C to cancel the selection.
